# Compact question-only control

This branch trains one compact grounding model with question-only text.

The experiment uses the existing `train.py`, `eval.py`, `dataset.py`, and `models/` layout. CLIP input is fixed at 336 pixels; architecture and loss settings are defined in code. No detector is involved. The offline detector experiment lives on `exp/yolo-detector`.

## Kaggle

Clone branch `exp/grounding-controls`. Enable a GPU and Internet for CLIP downloads. Use Kaggle's installed Torch/Torchvision and install missing dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers tqdm pillow
```

The dataset root contains `train_grounding.json`, `val_grounding.json`, `test_grounding.json`, image directories `train/`, `val/`, `test/`, and masks in `binary_masks_png/<split>/`. Evaluation requires masks for the selected split.

Run in a `%%bash` cell, replacing the dataset path:

```bash
set -e
cd /kaggle/working/VizWiz-VQA-Grounding
DATA_ROOT=/kaggle/input/YOUR_DATASET/vizwiz
python train.py --data-root "$DATA_ROOT" --num-epochs 100 --batch-size 1 --num-workers 2 --seed 42 --output-dir /kaggle/working/outputs

python eval.py --data-root "$DATA_ROOT" --checkpoint /kaggle/working/outputs/model_final_epoch100.pt --dataset test --batch-size 1 --num-workers 2 --output-dir /kaggle/working/results
```

Training selects CUDA automatically and supports `torchrun`; batch size is global across GPUs. `--seed`, `--num-workers`, and the usual training/data/output controls are retained. Evaluation accepts an optional `--device`. Run either script with `--help` for its short argument list.

## Single-image prediction

```bash
python predict_save.py --checkpoint /path/to/model_final_epoch100.pt --image /path/to/image.jpg --question "What does it say?" --output /kaggle/working/mask.png
python visualize_predictions.py --checkpoint /path/to/model_final_epoch100.pt --image /path/to/image.jpg --question "What does it say?" --output /kaggle/working/overlay.png
```

`IoU.py` delegates to `eval.py`. Existing experiment weight keys are preserved. Raw weights and ordinary checkpoint dictionaries are accepted; model tensor names and shapes must match this branch. `docs/` and `tests/` remain ignored and local. CPU smoke tests do not establish real-data accuracy or GPU performance.


## Training output and separate evaluation

Training reads only the training split: no validation dataset is loaded and no validation runs, including after the final epoch. This also applies to teacher training and both refinement stages.

At completion, training saves exactly one raw `state_dict`: `model_final_epoch<N>.pt`, matching the baseline format. It contains model tensors only, with no optimizer, scaler, epoch wrapper, or RNG state. There are no automatic `last.pt` or `best.pt` saves, and `--validate-every` is removed. `--save-every` defaults to **10** and saves resumable `checkpoint_epoch10.pt`, `checkpoint_epoch20.pt`, etc., containing model, optimizer, scaler, and completed epoch. Use `--save-every 0` to disable these periodic checkpoints while still saving the final raw model.

Raw weights load directly without `config.json`. If present, the saved configuration is read to retain the original run settings; checkpoints already include those settings. `history.jsonl` contains training losses only. Run `eval.py` separately with `--dataset val` or `--dataset test`; the commands above show the final weight filename for their epoch count.

To train further from these weights, use `--init-checkpoint /path/to/model_final_epoch<N>.pt`. This starts a new optimizer and epoch counter; `--num-epochs` is the number of additional epochs. Distillation still requires its teacher. To resume a periodic checkpoint, use `--resume-checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint_epoch10.pt` with its existing output directory or a fresh one; optimizer/scaler state and completed epoch are restored, and `--num-epochs` is the final total epoch count. Older supported full checkpoints remain loadable.

Existing output directories are accepted for all training modes. Matching model filenames and `config.json` are overwritten; other model files remain. History is appended to `history.jsonl`, creating it if absent. To continue in a fresh Kaggle notebook, only the resumable checkpoint is needed to restore training state; no previous history or `config.json` is required. Dataset files and any teacher required by the experiment must still be available.


## Code layout

- `models/model.py`: this branch's grounding model and any teacher/coarse model it needs.
- `models/image_encoder.py` and `models/text_encoder.py`: CLIP feature extraction.
- `models/mask_decoder.py`: the decoder used by this experiment.
- `train.py`: construct the model and dataset, run training, save checkpoints and final weights.
- `eval.py`: construct the model, load weights, evaluate and export masks.
- `utils.py`: batch transfer and a few plain weight-loading helpers.

The separate backbone, experiment, and checkpoint modules and model factory are removed. Training still uses no validation, saves resumable checkpoints every 10 epochs by default, and writes final raw weights.

Training shows a batch progress bar for each epoch (rank 0 under `torchrun`), and evaluation shows a batch progress bar. Install `tqdm` alongside Transformers and Pillow in the Kaggle notebook.
