# Tasks: VizWiz-VQA-Grounding
 This project was developed for the [VizWiz-VQA-Grounding Challenge](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/visual-qa/) 2025. The goal is to return grounded visual evidence for answers to visual questions posed by people with visual impairments. 


## 🎶Task Objective
Given an image-question pair, the task is to predict the region in the image that supports the most common answer. This is known as **answer grounding**, and predictions are evaluated based on **mean Intersection over Union (IoU)** with human-annotated binary masks.
